# AGENTS.md

## Required Workflow
1. Read `Final_Spec.md` at the start of every task.
2. Before beginning implementation, map requested work to `Development_Tasks.md` dependencies and execute in dependency order.
3. When working inside a module under `modules/`, read that module's `$ModuleName_Spec.md` first.
4. When working on a module, check `additional_tasks/` within that module for extra completion items.
5. Keep code modular, expressive, and replaceable.
6. Provide testing with at least 95% branch coverage.
7. Prioritize extreme observability and beautiful output quality.
8. Ensure the full system can be run and tested locally on Windows without friction.
9. Run all tests before committing.
10. After completing work, create `$taskslug_work_description.md` in `/workdescriptions`.
11. After completing work, check off the relevant checkbox in `Work_Checklist.md`.
