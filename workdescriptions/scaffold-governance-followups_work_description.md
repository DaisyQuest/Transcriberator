# scaffold-governance-followups_work_description.md

## Summary
Completed governance and structure follow-up tasks requested after scaffold review.

## Work Performed
- Added `additional_tasks/` directory to each module root with a local README placeholder.
- Enhanced root `AGENTS.md` with additional execution workflow requirements:
  - inspect module `additional_tasks/`
  - run all tests before commit
  - create task work description artifacts
  - check off checklist completion boxes
- Added a checked completion checkbox entry in `Work_Checklist.md` under a dedicated task completion section.
- Added and executed automated scaffold validation tests.

## Validation
- Confirmed all module roots now contain `additional_tasks/`.
- Confirmed AGENTS workflow requirements include the newly requested instructions.
- Confirmed task completion checkbox is present and checked.
